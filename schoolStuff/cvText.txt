Hello,
my name is Filip Jay Doba, I'm a Slovak student, finishing high school this year. Throughout my studies and extracurricular time I've found myself to be a great team player and communnicator, whether it's technical or more presonal topics. I often find it easier to support leaders (when it comes to in my eyes sensible ideas ofc) than to lead personally, though I don't have a problem with either. 

2014 - present = Škola pre Mimoriadne Nadané Deti a Gymnázium, Teplická 7, BA = School for gifted children Bratislava
Focus on physics, mathematics and informatics through vocational subjects
Leaving Exam (Maturitná skúška) chosen subjects - Slovak Language, English Language B2, Physics, Mathematics, Informatics


Work experience
None so far, school and extracurricular activities take up too much time to practically consider extra work

Extracurricular activities
2019 - present = member of KOZA - Carpathian nature protection and altruism association - weekend/week-long stays in landscape parks and other protected natural areas focused on the protection
