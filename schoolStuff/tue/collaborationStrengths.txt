In order to make any sort of collaboration work, I believe that it is not enough to be a good listener and be open to ideas not your own, though that is obviously an important part. Also being determined enough to make your voice heard, to be confident in your capabilities and in what you can bring to the table and team are integral to building and upholding a successful team. Knowing which approach is the best in a given situation is in my eyes one of the most important traits in a team member.
Speaking from personal experience working on school-held game jams, even in a team as small as five, setting a leader greatly improved both our work time and the end result. We had to allow decisions to be made without some of us getting included, to forgo total democracy in order to speed up the process, as many compromises had to be made quickly enough to actually save time.
In the end, my ideal of cooperation boils down to openness in communication and knowing who I'm working with, their weaknesses and strengths, all things I believe I've built up enough to rely on.

and that most of our cool ideas would have to be scrapped at some point, and having a single person to make these decisions would have been very helpful in comparison to us going back and forth over even small changes for way too long. Although democracy may be the best solution politically, the luxury of time is not always a given.


and taking part in several group-based math and physics competitions, I know what it's like to have to switch between the two - 
I am certain in my ability to do both, as
There are times when a good leader is needed as much as good workers, for instance 



what I need to highlight:
 - I can allow decisions to be made by someone other than me to forgo democracy and speed up the process, especially when it comes to cutting potential changes and deciding compromises, so it doesn't fall to two of us respectfully offering to drop our idea to make way for the other's.
 - I know exactly what I'm good at and where to volunteer to pick up work, but also where not to, and also knowing the others' strengths and weaknesses to ask for help in the correct places instead of pestering someone who may not be able to help as well
 - in the end, it boils down to openness in communication
