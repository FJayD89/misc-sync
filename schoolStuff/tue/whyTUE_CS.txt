First off, ever since about two years ago, I've had my sights set on studying computer science, in one form or another. CS as a subject was always around the top of my list all throughout highschool, and even before. Why? I just really enjoyed playing around with computers, not content with using them like everyone else, but figuring out what they could be capable of even before I started programming. Once that hit, my enthusiasm only grew, as I found my way through more languages and tools. 

Simply put, CS has been one of my most enjoyed subjects all throughout highschool, and continuing with it came to me as the most natural option whenever debating where to go on. The possibility of studying in English made just made the choice easier to make, with a course description fitting right into my expectations. 

I code whenever I can and whatever I feel like - mostly various online challenges and problem archives, occasionally personal projects - but my interests also lie in the theoretical parts of the 'science'. Of course, that requires having quite a bit more of time to spend, something I count on having

Another thing I like about this course is that it brings multiple group assignments and projects, which are obviously a big part of any practical application, as I've olny had scarce experience with programming-based teamwork
