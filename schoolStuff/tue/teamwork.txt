In order to make any sort of collaboration work, I believe that it is not enough to be a good listener and be open to ideas not your own, though that is obviously an important part. Also being determined enough to make your voice heard, to be confident in your capabilities and in what you can bring to the table and team are integral to building and upholding a successful team. Knowing which approach is the best in a given situation is in my eyes one of the most important traits in a team member.
Speaking from personal experience working on school-held game jams, even in a team as small as five, setting a leader greatly improved both our work time and the end result. We had to allow decisions to be made without some of us getting included, to forgo total democracy in order to speed up the process, as many compromises had to be made quickly enough to actually save time.
In the end, my ideal of cooperation boils down to openness in communication and knowing who I'm working with, their weaknesses and strengths, all things I believe I've built up enough to rely on.
