My interest in computer science stems mainly from all the computer games I used to play (and still do), thinking whether and how I could create something like that myself, and being able to try it, since that was a large part of my early IT classes. Later, I discovered that math makes up a significantly larger part of CS than I had previously thought, which only made me enjoy it more as a whole.
What especially drove me, and still does, is how easy it is to start creating something - all it takes is a computer, a free IDE, and an idea, along with the plentiful resources available online.
I'd say I'm especially interested in the really theoretical parts, most connected to other parts of mathematics, but that's not to say I'm not excited for the rest of the course.  The fact that there will also be cross-program cooperation projects pleasantly surprised me, since it will offer more points of view to consider from others, along with their knowledge being something to learn from too.
