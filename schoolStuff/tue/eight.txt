To be as sure as I can about keeping up with the workload, the most straightforward answer would be by doing things as soon as possible, but that alone can't be the whole solution. This was a problem I used to have when we'd get assignments from multiple classes to work out over weekends/holidays, all usually due the first class after said break. I'd always be thinking about everything I needed to do simultaneously, which often led to rapid switching between assignments or doing something completely unrelated. What helped me was allocating a certain time window to doing something - half an hour if it was for a worksheet, a few hours for an essay, up to a day for larger projects and presentation preparation, and not keeping anything else in mind, if I could help it. When I felt my focus was slipping into something different, I took a break and afterwards focused on that other thing. This doesn't just relate to schoolwork, but to almost all other time-consuming activities, like my own coding projects too for example. Alongside that, I'm already used to running multiple calendars for all sorts of deadlines and dates I need to keep and reminders for weekly occurrences.
