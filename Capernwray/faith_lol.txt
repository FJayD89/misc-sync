Would I consider myself a christian?
Sure, uh.. 

I believe that some guy, approximately named Jesus, was born from a virgin about 2000 years ago, lived for a bit, got seriously tempted, amassed a near-cult following, caused unrests in the Roman empire, was tried, which failed to find any real dirt on him, but on the urging of a very loud group which might and might not have been a majority, he was crucified and died, which turned out to be the universal equivalent of all past, current and future humans dying for their sins, including myself. Three days later, though, he was up and walked again, which really raised the spirits of all who followed him, and despite him leaving 40 days after that, those people carried on with his word about loving one's enemies, giving things up for the poor and needy, and trusting in the LORD.





I was baptised at 12, and since then, God has beed a pretty important part of my life. I attend church regularly, am in touch with the elders there, and try to live up to the ideals set in the Bible.
