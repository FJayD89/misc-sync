Describe involvement in church
I'm a member of a small church (~50 people total), a part of the free evangelical Brethren church in Slovakia. I help with the worship music playing the piano, with my brother and dad. Once per month I prepare bible study activites for younger teens (11-15). During the summer, I help organise church camps for kids and teens with a larger team, usually focused on sport activites.
