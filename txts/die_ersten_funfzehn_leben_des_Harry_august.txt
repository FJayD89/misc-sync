Plot
- Harry lives a somewhat unexciting life - grows up with adoptive parents in an uneasy youth, fights in the war and believes in it, and eventually dies. But suddenly, he is a child again, and not being able to come to terms his situation, throws himself out of a window of a mental hospital at the ripe age of seven. The next time around, he is more prepared, and travels the world in search of answers through religion - just about all of them, in fact. He also uses his knowledge of the war to stay alive. Not finding a satisfactory answer, he turns to science, but eventually finds himself it dieselbe hospital as two lives ago, explaining the future to his psych, who ends up torturing him. In time, outside of time, he learns of the Cronus Club - a society of people like him who support each other throughout time. He also meets Vincent for the first time, who he discovers to also be kalachakra through mention of technology which won't be invented for a decade. Victor shares his goal with Harry - to completely understand the world with science, to create a machine that could compute reality. 

In a message from the future, he learns that the end of the world is happening sooner and sooner each time around, and figures it must be caused by Vincent, who is manipulating causality, making events happen sooner. Vincent invites Harry to help with his research, usually based in Soviet Russia, and Harry accepts, managing to bring the 21st century into the 20th. After finding out Vincent destroyed the Cronus club in Leningrad, made those who were part of it never born, they to turn from colleagues to enemies, Harry becoming disillusioned with their work. He tries to escape, fails, and Vincent makes him Forget - and to a kalachakra, Forgetting is a true death, or at least truer than the usual one. Harry remembers though, as he is a mnemonic, having a perfect memory on top of being a kalachakra. Thus truth is his greatest strength and secret. 
More clubs get destroyed, and with a handful of trusted allies, he takes on a multi-lifelong quest to earn Vincent's trust, convince him he doesn't remember anything, and find his origin. Where Vincent was really born. To cause him, to never have been born.


Complexity should be your excuse for inaction


I love this book, as it's a SF time-travel, with the time travel not being SF-based. The philosophical moments, conversations of science, the mechanics of the world Catherine Webb created are a wonder.
It doesn't read easy, doesn't follow chronology, introduces characters out of order, but rewards the reader for pulling through with a story so complex and captivating it takes more than one eternity to tell.
