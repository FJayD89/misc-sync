[a,b] = 2^a + 3^b = simple numbers
show if we can work with simples up to n, we can create all until the next simple

if there is such n that can't be written as a sum, n-1
Let n be the smallest num that can't be written as a sum.
Thus, all up to n-1 can be
So there just isn't a valid combination of previous sums that would sum to n
Actually, just a pair of sums
For ex., 19 = [0,2] + [1,1] + [2,0] = 
	([0,2] + [1,1]) + [2,0] = 15 + 4
	[0,2] + ([1,1] + [2,0]) = 9 + 10
	
That's the same as saying there's no sum we could add a simple to make it equal n
There's only so many simples though, way less than n, that could be a starting point

If you have a sum [a1,b1] + [a2,b2] + ... + [a_n,b_n]
How many simples can you add?
Say a1=bn=0, ie worst case
Well worst case is completed

For at least one simple < n there apparently is 

Take that one, what with it?

[1,2] + [2,1] = 12 + 18 = 30

no asi nič
30 can't be written with a zero
