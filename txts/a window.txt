hi
i feel like a stranger in my own mind
i've mentioned to a lot of people that I have to pull myself into doing just about anything these days, and it's going worse than they probably think
i need to get outside, do anything that's not pc related
miss people 
i'm leaving in a few days, and feel none of the excitement that would usually precede a trip like this
it's gonna be such an experience, no doubt about it
and something is so getting screwed up by me
i can taste it
can't even write properly
haven't gotten anything down in days
so much pinging around my head
getting focused nowhere
taking a total break would be more of an improvement than anything else by this point
friendepression is a thing
and not being able to get myself to do
towards writing
i've a tendency to want to archive stuff
save every last bit
document, aby dobre bolo
same with my mind
though writing down won't change me directly, it's a step out of the cycle
breaks always starting at the same point
i've lied to everyone
still do, constantly
to save myself the shame, or others of the burden of worry
i can't
talk to 
i listen to podcasts, hoping to zachytiť aspoň časť na trvalejšie
if you had a dictionary with a definition for every word used in it, alone, none of them would have any meaning, since they would either by defined circularly, or improperly
being with others gives me a break from this state of mind arising from being alone
not that I have anything against my dear siblings
just the age gap i guess
but
is/should it just be an escape?
or is that indicative that i have undealt with self-issues
deep in discussion, i tend to forget the world outside of the moment
it must be beautiful, though it's sorta hard to experience consciously
the line count is unimportant
i started watching GDQ in the bg, then it became the main event
the worst part is, this isn't everything
it's questionable if it ever could be
