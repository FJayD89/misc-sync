From tomorrow's talk to everything
 - was still thinking about texting you, and that led to a strange train of thought I don't properly remember

Forgot 90% of it
I'm way too calculating with social stuff
 - overthinking, trying to rationalize every word, to find the correct way to say what I really mean and whether that's even what I want to say
Blindly reaching for a balance I wouldn't recognize
 - though I have an idea what the above thing means, and could approximately describe it, I couldn't give an example, since the point is to make it understood by others, which I can't be the judge of
Trying to adhere to a 'personality' that isn't there
 - having a different Verhalten in front of different people isn't that unusual, it's more about that there's not default, no 'real' me
  - sidenote, since I don't feel like personality nor behavior is a good enough word, I just use a German term even though it probably has connotations I'm not aware of, just for the chance it is the word i'm looking for
   - or I get to learn what it really means
  - sidenote #2 'real' me sounds way too dramatic, I'll just add this smiley to emphasize it wasn't meant that seriously :)
All to have friends
 - as in, to have friends, you have to interact with them just like with other people, just 'special'
  - aand that's way too cold and impersonal, 
I don't know people
 - just spending time with someone doesn't mean you have to get to know them, and if they don't wan't to have something found out it's not too hard - based on knowing myself and that time a guy in our year died
 - and as such I base friendships on spent time, not how much you know, therefore you can get hurt
Some time ago that didn't matter, but times change
 - Julka has this nice story - on the first day of school, way back when, her to-be friend came over, introduced herself, and they were besties for years following that. It used to be easier not to think too deeply about friends
And with them, so do I
 - well, I best know how my own thinking changed
Others too, I assume
Spending time just to have fun used to be easier
Thought less about what to say
I say and do things, and immediately regret them despite way overthinking them
 - coincidentally, very similar to how I play chess - I spend minutes on a move, and immediately see why it sucks the moment I play it
Hate having to use people as emotional support
 - hate is too strong of a word, just being open is pain
Still a foreign term
 - I know what I feel, why should I care if you think that's invalid
 - when I talk to people about this, it's more along the lines of 'Hey, you seem really confused about what I did/said, I'll try to explain' and then I'll not explain really well
 - I can barely 'emotionally support' myself, no chance about others
  - empathising isn't hard, I get what you're going through, sometimes, but I don't know what to say to make you feel better
  - and I get you're saying something to make me feel better, but it's the thought that matters, not the words
  - the above points aren't directed towards anyone in particular, just to make that clear :)
 
Labels
 - coloured stickers to mentally put on people to not have to remember everything about them
  - unfortunately, they work by simplifying the person down to bits of information
 - attributes aren't binary (true/false)
  - nor can you give them discrete values 1-10
  - everything is a spectrum/irrational value, not just an integer
Can't avoid them, still I try
In some places
Mostly my own
 - can't quite remember what this was supposed to mean
Serve one another OKAY BUT WHAT IF THEY DON'T WANT
 - to be served/supported/helped
Just ask
Makes you sound weird for not being able to intuit that automatically
Does it?
Nope
Just made it all up
To support my own flawed model
Creating virtual variables and forces just to make the math work out 
 - I'd just read an article that day about how most of what we call physics are just math equations supposed to best approximate experimentally achieved results, from pre-newtonian mechanics to all sorts of modern quantum theories and dark matter
 - which is similar to what I do when describing how I think about certain things
  - especially communication and relationships of all kinds
Hey, I'm writing :)

Anna, you use smileys exactly as I would, if I was honest



Look at me, jumping around again
 - from thought to thought, after I remembered to fix some code
Or running from myself
 - from having to write about myself
  - even though it's often actually fun


 - analysing my own thoughts, wow
 - better than Slovak literature heh
  - there are good pieces though, if you know what to look for
  - and I should know, since that makes up like half of my Slovak finals
 - one of the reasons explaining to others was so hard is that it's not sequential, there's no logical throughline, it's self-referential
 - having a jumble of everything makes it easier to address things one by one, even if not every tiny detail gets addredssed
 

Gonna cut myself off here before I spend too long on this
