I've been thinking about what made the Erasmus experience so different (again, I know), and I've come to the conclusion that the main point is that people cared. Just about every conversation I was in I really felt the person/people I was talking with cared about the topic, mostly since everything was so personal. To contrast it with something, at the Su≈°i camp, the conversations were usually about something related to the ciphers, or food or the games or whatever, just not the people, I guess. In Regenstauf, part of the reason was definitely our diversity, or when it came to the sk team, the fact I knew most of them. Though, I did connect quite a bit with the new (to me) Slovak people, which is interesting in its own right. It must've been the general atmosphere (although I sorta dislike the term, I've got no good sub at the moment) of openness and the okayness of just striking up a convo with someone.
